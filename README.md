    ------ This Project will be a kind of duplication of whatsapp and how I understand it. The outcome will most likely be the same but the logic and implementation are way different.
    ------ I am using C++ along with Qt for the GUI implementation which will allow the app to be cross-platform.
    ------ Within Qt, I am mainly using QtWidgets and QtCore classes which encapsulates QTcpSocket and QTcpSocket for the Network communication part.
    ------ All Data serialization (files, voice notes, text messages) are operated using QDataStream (another QtWidgets's class)
    ------ The app uses an hybrid architecture. It uses both the Server--clients and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture for large (refers to the message's size in byte) voice notes and files.
